# Codes for library web sites
This repo contains the web sites of the AOI library (Japan).
Because of the reorganization of the library structure, the offcial library web sites (2021) should be migrated into somowhere in 2022.
Some pages could not be migrated - I don't know which sites will be erased through this action.
This repo has thus the archiving function.

## Pages

There are some pages for the Japan library.  

* Signatursystematik  
You find the "Signatursystematik (System for the shelf number)" of the library. You can also "browse" the library books online.
